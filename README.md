# Telegram Channel Analysis Tool

A powerful Python-based tool for performing in-depth analysis of public Telegram channels. This script goes beyond the basic analytics provided by Telegram to extract granular data about post performance, engagement, and content strategy, exporting it all to a clean CSV file for further research.

## About The Project

Telegram is a rich source of data, but understanding the true performance of a channel requires looking deeper than surface-level metrics. This tool was built to automate the process of fetching and analyzing a channel's entire post history, providing actionable insights for content creators, marketers, and researchers.

By leveraging the Telegram API via the Telethon library, this script can systematically extract and analyze thousands of posts, revealing patterns that would be impossible to spot manually.

## Core Features (Current Functionality)

The current version of the tool can connect to any public Telegram channel and extract the following information for each post:

*   **üìà Post Views:** The total number of views for each post.
*   **‚ù§Ô∏è Engagement Metrics:**
    *   Number of times a post was **forwarded**.
    *   Number of **comments/replies** (for channels with linked discussion groups).
    *   Detailed breakdown of emoji **reactions** (e.g., üëç: 500, üéâ: 120).
*   **üìÑ Post Type:** Automatically identifies the content type, including:
    *   Text
    *   Photo
    *   Video
    *   Link/Web Preview
    *   File/Document
    *   Combinations of the above.
*   **üìè Post Size:**
    *   **Character count** for text messages.
    *   **File size** (in MB) for all media attachments (videos, photos, documents).
*   **üíæ Data Export:** All extracted data is neatly organized and saved to a **CSV file**, ready for analysis in Excel, Google Sheets, or a data science environment.

## Roadmap: Planned Features

This project aims to evolve into a comprehensive and user-friendly analysis suite. The following features are planned for future development.

### Tier 1: Enhanced Content Analysis (NLP)

*   [ ] **Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of post text to gauge the overall tone of the channel.
*   [ ] **Keyword & Topic Extraction:** Identify the most frequently used keywords and topics to understand the channel's core content themes.
*   [ ] **Link & Domain Analysis:** Extract all external links and aggregate them by domain to see which sources are cited most often.
*   [ ] **Hashtag & Mention Analysis:** Track the usage and performance of hashtags and identify collaboration patterns through mentions.

### Tier 2: Data Visualization & Reporting

*   [ ] **Generate Visual Charts:** Automatically create and save graphs to visualize key trends, such as:
    *   Views and engagement over time (line charts).
    *   Performance comparison between different post types (bar charts).
    *   Correlation plots (e.g., post length vs. engagement).
*   [ ] **Create a Word Cloud:** Generate a word cloud image from the most common keywords for a quick, intuitive summary of the channel's focus.
*   [ ] **Automated PDF/HTML Reports:** Generate a shareable, professional report that includes summary statistics and all generated charts.

### Tier 3: User Experience & Performance

*   [ ] **Command-Line Arguments:** Allow users to specify the channel, post limit, and other settings via the command line instead of editing the script.
*   [ ] **Date Range Filtering:** Add options to analyze posts only within a specific start and end date.
*   [ ] **Incremental Fetching (Caching):** For ongoing analysis, the tool will have an option to only fetch new posts since the last run, dramatically speeding up the process.
*   [ ] **Database Integration:** Add support for saving data to an SQLite database for more robust storage and faster querying of large datasets.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.6+**
*   An active **Telegram Account**
*   **Telegram API Credentials** (`api_id` and `api_hash`)
    *   You can get these from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) under "API development tools".

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
    cd your_repository_name
    ```
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `telethon` and `pandas`)*.
    Alternatively, install them manually:
    ```sh
    pip install telethon pandas
    ```

### How to Use

1.  Open the main Python script (e.g., `telegram_analyzer.py`).
2.  Enter your `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, and the `PHONE_NUMBER` associated with your Telegram account in the configuration section.
3.  Set the `CHANNEL_USERNAME` to the public channel you wish to analyze.
4.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python telegram_analyzer.py
    ```
5.  The first time you run it, you will be prompted to enter your phone number, a login code, and your 2FA password (if enabled). A `.session` file will be created to keep you logged in for future runs.
6.  Once the script finishes, you will find a `.csv` file in the same directory containing all the analyzed data.
